# altair-streamlit-demo

This repo contains examples of Altair visualisations and Streamlit dashboards

* cars_example: based on a blog post [blog post](https://sakizo-blog.com/en/586/).
  * It creates a dashboard using the cars dataset in the vega-datasets library.
  * I also added a notebook to show a corresponding plot and slider in Altair.
