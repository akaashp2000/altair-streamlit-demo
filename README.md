# altair-streamlit-demo

This repo contains examples of Altair visualisations and Streamlit dashboards

* cars_example: based on a [blog post](https://sakizo-blog.com/en/586/).
  * It creates a dashboard using the cars dataset in the vega-datasets library.
  * I also added a notebook to show a corresponding plot and slider in Altair.
* sales_example: based on a [blog post](https://blog.streamlit.io/drill-downs-and-filtering-with-streamlit-and-altair/)
  * It creates a dashboard based on dummy sales data.
  * Selection filters are for the Altair chart, rather than the Streamlit selectors as in cars_examples.
  * I also added a notebook to show corresponding plots in Altair.
